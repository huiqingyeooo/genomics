#  A repository of notes and codes useful for bioinformatics
## Helpful notes and tutorials
- Introduction to bash and cheat sheets: https://github.com/NBISweden/GAAS/blob/master/annotation/knowledge/Bash_lecture.pdf
- Tutorials for analysis of low coverage genome data: https://github.com/nt246/lcwgs-guide-tutorial/tree/main
  - data processing, genotype snp calling, linkage disequilibrium, population structure, popgen summary stats

## List of bioinformatic software/programs
### Programs for popgen analyses with genotype likelihoods
- Ngstools (https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsTools#ngscovar)

### Other programs
- subsamplebam (https://github.com/VDBWRAIR/subsamplebam)
  - Subsamples bam to obtain more even read depth across the genome

- twisst2 (https://github.com/simonhmartin/twisst2)
  - Topology weighting. Summarises genealogies in terms of the relative abundance of different sub-tree topologies

- variantBam (https://github.com/walaj/VariantBam)
  - extract/count specific reads that intersect some region around variant locations

- Supercrunch (https://github.com/dportik/SuperCRUNCH)
  - For phylogenetic datasets
  - Construct supermatrices from genbank
