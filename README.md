#  A repository of notes and codes useful for bioinformatics
## Helpful notes and tutorials
- Introduction to bash and cheat sheets: https://github.com/NBISweden/GAAS/blob/master/annotation/knowledge/Bash_lecture.pdf
- Tutorials for analysis of low coverage genome data: https://github.com/nt246/lcwgs-guide-tutorial/tree/main
.. data processing, genotype snp calling, linkage disequilibrium, population structure, popgen summary stats

## Software
### Programs for popgen analyses with genotype likelihoods
